# Overview

hijack takes in four arguments:
```
$ ./hijack <pointer> <type> <memory location> <vtable> <class hierarchy>
```

## Pointer

`<pointer>` determines which pointer the exploit is going to target and has two possible inputs:

1. `vptr` : the exploit will overwrite the vptr in an object
2. `object_ptr` : the exploit changes the pointer to the object

## Type

`<type>` refers to the type of attack that will be carried out and has 6 possible inputs:

1. `object_bounds_overflow`
2. `sub-object_bounds_overflow`
3. `type_confusion`
4. `use_after_free`
5. `buffer_overflow`
6. `pointer_overwrite`

## Memory Location

`<memory location>` specifies in which memory region the attack is carried out. It has 3 possible inputs:

1. `heap`
2. `stack`
3. `global`

## Vtable  

`<vtable>` determines the location of the vtable that the overwritten vptr points to(if any). It has 3 possible inputs:

1. `reuse` : a vtable from an existing object is used
2. `injection` : a fake vtable is created and pointed to
3. `corruption`

## Class Heirarchy

`<class heirarchy` refers to the relationship between the objects used in the attack. It has 3 possible inputs:

1. `independent`
2. `inherited`
3. `multiple_inheritance`
