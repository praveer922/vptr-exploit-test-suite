# Overview

hijack takes in four arguments:
```
$ ./hijack <pointer> <type> <memory location> <class hierarchy> <vtable location>
```

## Pointer

`<pointer>` determines which pointer the exploit is going to target and has two possible inputs:

1. `vptr` : the exploit will overwrite the vptr in an object
2. `object_ptr` : the exploit changes the pointer to the object

## Type

`<type>` refers to the type of attack that will be carried out and has 6 possible inputs:

1. `object_bounds_overflow`
2. `sub-object_bounds_overflow`
3. `type_confusion`
4. `use_after_free`
5. `buffer_overflow`
6. `pointer_overwrite`
